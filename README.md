# ASP.NET MVC Final Project

This document describes the **final project assignment** for the **ASP.NET MVC** course at Telerik Academy.

## Project Description

Design and implement an **ASP.NET MVC application**. It can be a discussion forum, blog system, e-commerce site, online gaming site, social network, or any other web application by your choice.

The application should have:
* **public part** (accessible without authentication)
* **private part** (available for registered users)
* **administrative part** (available for administrators only)

### Public Part

The **public part** of your projects should be **visible without authentication**.

This public part could be the application start page, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.

### Private Part (Users only)

**Registered users** should have private part in the web application accessible after **successful login**.

This part could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

### Administration Part

**System administrators** should have administrative access to the system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the system, e.g. to create/edit/delete users and other administrators, to edit/delete offers in a bid system, to edit/delete photos and album in a photo sharing system, to edit/delete posts in a blogging system, edit/delete products and categories in an e-commerce system, etc.

## General Requirements

Your Web application should use the following technologies, frameworks and development techniques:
* Use **ASP.NET MVC** and **Visual Studio 2015** with Update 1/2
* Have at least **10 controllers**
* Have at least **30 actions**
* You should use **Razor** template engine for generating the UI
	* You may use any JavaScript library of your choice
		* For example Kendo UI widgets (with the ASP.NET MVC Wrappers), Chart.js for charts, etc.
	* ASP.NET WebForms is not allowed
	* Use at least **2 sections** and at least **5 partial views**
	* Use at least **5 editor or display templates**
* You should use Grid control and Kendo Window from Telerik UI For ASP.Net MVC  
* Use **MS SQL Server** as database back-end
	* Use **Entity Framework 6** to access your database
	* Using **repositories(in the service layer) and service layer** is a must()
* Use at least **2 areas** in your project (e.g. for administration)
* Create **tables with data** with **server-side paging and sorting** for every model entity
	* You can use Kendo UI grid, jqGrid, any other library or generate your own HTML tables
* Create **beautiful and responsive UI**
	* You may use **Bootstrap** or **Materialize**
	* You may change the standard theme and modify it to apply own web design and visual styles (bonus)
* Use the standard **ASP.NET Identity System** for managing users and roles

* Use **AJAX form ** communication in some parts of your application
* Use **caching** of data where it makes sense (e.g. starting page)
* Use **Ninject** (or any other dependency container) and **Automapper**
* Write unit tests for 3 of the controllers. **100%** coverage for each. Controllers should have atleast some basic logic. Write unit tests for routing. 
* Apply **error handling** and **data validation** to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side)
* Use GitHub and take advantage of the **branches** for writing your features. At least 3 branches. (Suggested branches: Master, Architecture, Private Area, Administration Area, Unit tests)
* **Documentation** of the project and project architecture (as `.md` file, including screenshots)
* 0 warnings in StyleCop with documentation features turned off

### Deliverables

Put the following in a **ZIP archive** and submit it (**each team member** submits the same file):
* The **source code** (everything except /bin/, /obj/, /packages/)
* The project documentation
* Screenshots of your application
* If hosted online - the URL of the application

### Public Project Defense

In 15 minutes demonstrate and defend the project. It includes:
* Live **demonstration** of the developed web application (please prepare sample data).
* Explain application structure and its **source code**: ASPX pages, C# code, data-bindings, ASCX controls, etc.
* Show the **commit logs** in the source control repository
